* This worksheet has several queries to monitor performance of bulk load executions. If you get a   *
* message about a missing PROGRESS_BAR function, run the CREATE statement for the PROGRESS_BAR UDF. *
*                                                                                                   *
* The final two queries allow you to suspend and resume running FileIngest stored procedures.       *
* After finihing the COPY INTO for a group of files, the procedure looks for new files marked       *
* WAITING. The "Kill Swith" query simply updates all files in the control table marked WAITING to   *
* SUSPENDED. This has the effect of killing all running FileIngest stored procedures gracefully.    *
*                                                                                                   *
